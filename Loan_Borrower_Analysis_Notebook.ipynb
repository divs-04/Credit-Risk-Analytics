Repeat borrowing is common, with borrowers often holding multiple loans and high total accounts, indicating potential exposure to over-leverage. Employment length and verification status together reveal that longer-tenured and verified borrowers consistently earn more, while very few high-income borrowers carry excessive debt (DTI > 43%).

Higher-risk grades (D–G) tend to have higher interest rates and slightly larger loans, while safer grades (A–C) dominate the number of loans issued. Debt consolidation and credit card purposes are the largest drivers of the portfolio, both in number and total loan amount, whereas niche purposes like small business, home improvement, and renewable energy contribute minimally. High-risk borrowers often have high revolving utilization or costly loans, as seen in the top-ranked loans with high interest rates and DTI, highlighting potential default risks. Combined analyses by term, grade, and purpose show that longer-term and higher-purpose loans carry higher rates, and the grade-purpose stack plots indicate moderate diversification with heavy concentration in a few key segments. The plots effectively visualize distributions, comparisons, and portfolio concentration, helping identify where credit exposure is highest.`"

    "\n",
    "`The loan portfolio overall is performing well, with most loans being current or fully paid; however, risk is concentrated in specific segments. Short-term loans (36-month) in mid-grades B, C, and D dominate defaults, while longer-term loans (60-month) contribute to risk in higher grades like E and F. Certain loan purposes—small business, medical, and debt consolidation—show higher default percentages, indicating that both borrower profile and loan purpose jointly influence risk. Past delinquencies emerge as a strong predictor of default: borrowers with 3–4 prior delinquencies account for a major portion of defaults, particularly when combined with high revolving utilization and moderate-to-high debt-to-income ratios, reflecting compounded financial stress. Interestingly, income bands have little effect on default rates, although wealthier borrowers tend to hold more accounts, which may subtly increase exposure. Higher interest rates correlate with higher defaults, especially among weaker credit grades and longer-term loans, demonstrating that repayment risk rises with borrowing cost. Grade migration analysis shows that while high-grade borrowers often maintain or improve their status, mid- and low-grade borrowers frequently experience deteriorating creditworthiness, signaling the need for ongoing monitoring. Finally, lenders adjust interest rates based on perceived borrower risk: most see stable or slightly increased rates over successive loans, reinforcing the link between repayment behavior and pricing strategy. Mid-grade, short-term loans for high-risk purposes, compounded by prior delinquencies and high financial leverage, form the core of portfolio risk, while income alone is not a strong predictor—highlighting the importance of multi-factor risk assessment, credit monitoring, and adaptive pricing strategies.` "

The highest default rates are seen in grade C (36-month term, 2.44%), followed by B (36-month, 1.85%) and D (36-month, 1.43%). Longer-term loans (60 months) have slightly lower percentages of charge-offs but still contribute to risk in higher grades like E and F. The bar plots clearly show the distribution of total loans and percentages across grades and terms, highlighting where defaults concentrate, while the heatmap effectively visualizes charged-off percentages, making it easy to identify the riskiest grade-term combinations.

    "`The Interest Rate Bands vs Default % analysis highlights that higher interest rates are strongly associated with greater default risk, particularly among lower grades and longer-term loans. Loans with rates above 20% (mostly grades E, F, G) show both higher absolute defaults and higher default percentages, while A and B-grade loans at lower rates (<15%) exhibit minimal defaults. Medium-risk borrowers (grades C and D) see rising defaults as rates move from 10–15% to 15–20%, showing a clear sensitivity to interest costs. The stacked bar plots illustrate how defaults concentrate in high-rate bands and lower grades, and the percentage plot confirms that high-rate, long-term loans disproportionately contribute to overall charged-off loans. Overall, interest rate is a key driver of repayment risk, especially for weaker credit grades and longer durations.`"

    "\n",
    "`A borrower’s personal traits and financial habits play a big role in whether they repay loans on time. People with stable jobs, longer work history, and owned or mortgaged homes tend to default less because they have more financial stability. Renters or those with short employment histories are more likely to default, especially on mid-risk loans, showing that instability increases repayment risk. Repeat defaulters, particularly those with many accounts or multiple active loans, show a pattern of financial stress and difficulty managing debt. Even high-income borrowers are not immune—verification alone does not prevent defaults. Mid-risk loan grades see higher defaults even among verified or wealthy borrowers, showing that loan quality and risk profile matter more than income verification alone.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Past loan behavior and borrowing patterns also strongly predict future repayment. Borrowers whose first loan was charged off often default again, while those who fully repaid or stayed current are more likely to maintain good repayment habits. Many repeat defaulters take larger loans over time, which increases their default risk, while some take smaller loans, possibly due to stricter lending limits. Even though income, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios influence repayment, they are not enough to fully predict defaults. Overall, lenders should combine information on employment stability, housing, loan history, borrowing patterns, and financial stress to identify high-risk borrowers early and manage their loan portfolios more effectively.`"

High-grade loans (A–B) remain low-risk across all segments, while lower grades (E–G) show elevated defaults, especially among less stable borrowers. The stacked bar plots vividly illustrate how defaults concentrate in unstable borrower profiles, making hotspots easy to identify.

Borrowers with more than 10 total accounts and multiple defaults represent consistently high-risk individuals who may be over-leveraged or struggling to manage debt. Most repeat defaulters have 2–4 past defaults, showing a clear pattern of recurring repayment challenges. The bar plot illustrates that the majority of borrowers default only twice, signaling the need for closer monitoring. These high-risk borrowers are prime candidates for stricter credit assessment, targeted intervention, or adjusted lending terms.

While verified borrowers generally have slightly higher average defaulted amounts, they also account for a larger number of defaulted borrowers, especially in mid-risk grades like C and D. This suggests that verification alone does not fully protect lenders from defaults among wealthy borrowers—loan grade and risk profile play a stronger role. Pie charts further reveal that verified borrowers make up a bigger share of both defaulted loans and defaulting borrowers, indicating that even financially strong individuals can default if the loan terms are riskier.

A large portion of repeat defaulters are taking bigger loans than their previous ones, indicating rising financial stress or over-leveraging, while others are borrowing smaller amounts, possibly reflecting tighter borrowing limits or cautious behavior. Boxplots show that the magnitude of increase in loan amounts is often substantial, with some borrowers escalating by over $15,000, whereas decreases can be equally dramatic. Scatterplots highlight that higher previous loans don’t always prevent larger subsequent defaults, suggesting that repeat defaulters may not learn from past risk. On average, borrowers who increase their loan size show a positive upward trend in default amounts, underlining the need for lenders to monitor borrowing patterns over time.

This indicates that elevated borrowing costs and financial strain increase default risk, even among relatively well-off borrowers. Despite these differences, a significant portion (36.2%) of borrowers still defaulted, highlighting that income alone is not enough to predict repayment. The pie chart confirms that most borrowers (82.2%) successfully repay, but monitoring interest and DTI remains crucial for identifying potential risks and guiding lending decisions.`"

    "`In Area E, we combined borrower and loan factors to uncover patterns that help improve portfolio health and reduce risk. Verification status matters less than loan grade—high-grade loans remain low-risk even if not verified, while low-grade loans are risky regardless. Borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios and high revolving utilization face much higher default risk, and short employment tenure slightly increases risk. Home ownership slightly influences rates and loan amounts, but the biggest risk comes from lower grades rather than ownership type.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Portfolio concentration shows that debt consolidation loans in grades B and C dominate exposure, making these segments critical for monitoring. Multi-grade borrowers (who take loans across grades) show slightly higher defaults and interest rates, indicating potential repeat borrowing and risk. Delinquency history is a strong early warning signal, as past delinquencies significantly increase default likelihood across grades. Finally, the safest lending zones combine high grades with popular purposes like debt consolidation, moving, and home improvement, offering high repayment percentages while maintaining portfolio scale. Overall, these insights guide lenders to focus on stable, high-grade borrowers and carefully monitor risky segments to improve portfolio performance.`"

Income verification has only a small effect—verified and non-verified borrowers in the same grade show similar default rates, indicating that verification alone does not significantly reduce risk. Mid-grades like C–D see noticeable jumps in defaults, suggesting these borrowers carry moderate risk that requires careful monitoring. Interestingly, average interest rates rise steadily as grade decreases, correlating with higher defaults and reflecting lenders’ attempt to price for risk. Scatterplots highlight this relationship, showing that loans with higher interest rates consistently have higher default percentages regardless of verification. Overall, the results suggest that while verification provides some assurance, loan grade and interest rate are far better indicators of default risk, guiding lenders to focus on loan quality and borrower risk profile.`"

For example, in grade F, borrowers who own homes had slightly higher interest rates (+0.05% vs grade average) while renters were slightly below average (-0.02%), indicating lenders may see owners as able to handle higher risk. Mortgage holders often took larger loans, like in grade G where their average loan amount was $19,062, about $465 above the grade average, while renters had smaller loans ($18,485, $112 below average). Across most grades, the differences are modest, showing that grade remains the main driver, but home-ownership subtly adjusts both interest rate and loan size. Overall, lenders appear to make small, data-driven tweaks based on property status to balance risk while keeping terms consistent with the grade.`"

Interestingly, borrowers with no prior delinquencies (clean) generally show much higher default rates than those with recorded delinquencies, with the difference growing from Grade A (delta = –1.95%) to Grade G (delta = –23.5%). This counterintuitive pattern suggests that in lower grades, prior delinquencies may already be accounted for in interest rates or lending terms, while clean borrowers could still be exposed to higher absolute default risk. The bar plots show that the impact of delinquency on default is largest in high-risk grades (E–G), emphasizing that even “clean” borrowers in these grades can be risky.

Grade B and C borrowers performing home improvement or debt consolidation loans also maintain decent repayment, typically around 33–37%. The heatmap clearly shows that higher-grade loans cluster in the top repayment zones, while lower grades (E–G) often have scattered and lower repayment percentages.Looking at loan volume versus repayment, larger segments like Grade A debt consolidation (12,170 loans) and Grade B debt consolidation (20,684 loans) dominate the portfolio but still maintain solid repayment, indicating both safety and portfolio scale. The boxplots and scatterplots reveal that high repayment percentages are concentrated in top grades, suggesting that lenders can focus on these safe lending zones to minimize risk while maintaining lending scale. Overall, targeting high-grade borrowers and proven purposes ensures portfolio stability and reduces default exposure.`"

    "# ***PROJECT SUMMARY***\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***This project analyzed a large lending dataset combining borrower profiles, loan characteristics, and repayment behavior to uncover patterns, assess risk, and recommend actionable strategies for lenders. The goal was to understand who the bank lends to, how loans perform, which factors drive defaults, and how to optimize portfolio health.***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***`1. Borrower Profile Analysis`***\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Borrowers are primarily middle-income individuals earning between $50k–$100k, with most holding 3–9 years of employment. This suggests a relatively stable mid-career population.`\n",
    "- `Home ownership is concentrated in mortgages (~50%) and rentals (~41%), while verified borrowers make up about two-thirds of the population. Verification improves lending confidence but is not a perfect predictor of repayment.`\n",
    "- `Borrowers often have multiple loans and high total credit accounts, signaling potential over-leverage risk.`\n",
    "- `Key insight: Employment stability, home ownership, and verification combined with credit grade are stronger predictors of repayment than income alone.`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***`2. Loan Portfolio Overview`***\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Loans mostly range from $1,000 to $40,000, with 36–60 month terms and average interest rates of 12.5%, reflecting risk-based pricing.`\n",
    "- `Debt consolidation and credit card refinancing dominate, both in number and total amount, while niche purposes (home improvement, small business, renewable energy) contribute minimally.`\n",
    "- `Grades B and C dominate the portfolio, while higher-risk grades (F and G) are smaller but carry higher interest rates.`\n",
    "- `Key insight: Portfolio is moderately diversified but concentrated in a few segments. Longer-term and higher-purpose loans tend to carry higher risk and rates, requiring careful monitoring.`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***`3. Loan Performance & Risk Analysis`***\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Majority of loans are current or fully paid, but risk clusters in mid-grade, short-term loans for high-risk purposes.`\n",
    "- `Borrowers with past delinquencies, high DTI, or high revolving utilization are far more likely to default.`\n",
    "- `Grade migration shows high-grade borrowers often improve or maintain status, while mid- and low-grade borrowers frequently deteriorate, signaling the need for ongoing credit monitoring.`\n",
    "- `Interest rate analysis confirms lenders price risk: higher rates correlate with higher default, particularly for weaker borrowers.`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***`4. Borrower Behavior & Repayment Patterns`***\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Stable employment and home ownership correlate with lower default rates. Renters and short-tenure employees are riskier.`\n",
    "- `Repeat borrowing and multi-loan behavior indicate financial stress, increasing default likelihood.`\n",
    "- `Borrower past behavior is predictive: first loan charged off → higher probability of future default; first loan fully paid → good repayment habit likely to continue.`\n",
    "- `Key insight: Combining borrower traits, financial habits, and loan history is critical to predict defaults effectively.`\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### ***`5. Advanced Portfolio Insights & Strategic Recommendations`***\n",
    "\n",
    "- `High DTI and revolving utilization significantly increase default risk; employment length slightly influences risk; home ownership influences rates modestly.`\n",
    "- `Debt consolidation in grades B–C dominates exposure, requiring active monitoring.`\n",
    "- `Multi-grade borrowers exhibit slightly higher defaults and interest rates, signaling repeat borrowing risk.`\n",
    "- `Delinquency history is the strongest early warning signal across all grades.`\n",
    "- `Safe lending zones: high-grade borrowers in common purposes (debt consolidation, moving, home improvement) offer high repayment percentages with scale.`"
